        <h1>Who we are</h1>
        <p>
          We are an organisation working with other organizations all over the
          world to protect and help children.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h1>How to help the children you see</h1>
        <p>
          By contacting us, you could be helping a child or more to grow in a
          healthier environment.
          <br />If you see a homeless child, an orphan, or a child being abused,
          go to our <a href="contact.html">Contact page</a> and fill in the
          information accurately about the children you see. <br />You do not
          have to provide your name when filling the information, we respect
          your privacy and we do not need to know any private information about
          you. <br />You can also help by <a href="donate.html">donating</a>.
          90% of your donations go to the organizations we work with, and the
          rest helps us find more children. <br />To stay updated about the
          children we help, you can go to our
          <a href="newsandevents.html">News and Events page</a>
          and to keep track of the children you contact us about, you can enter
          your name and email, and enable email notifications to get notified
          whenever we make progress with the case you submitted or if we have
          any upcoming events you might be interested in.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p>
          When we recieve your messages about the children, we filter them using
          the information you entered, that is by location, age, and state.
          <br />After filtering, we choose the most proper organization that we
          work with and send them the information you sent us. <br />Then, this
          organization finds the children and helps them and keeps us updated
          about how they're doing and where they are.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h1>What our goal is</h1>
        <p>
          Our goal is to help make this world a better place by saving children
          from their unsafe environments.
